Description: Functions to generate test error estimates using cross validation, 
    based on how a survey design is constructed
    (SRS, clustering, stratification, and/or unequal sampling weights).
    You can input linear and logistic regression models, along with data and a 
    type of survey design in order to get an output that can help you determine
    which model best fits the data using K-fold cross validation.
    Our draft paper on "K-Fold Cross-Validation for Complex Sample Surveys"
    (under review; a copy is in the `data-raw` folder of our GitHub repo)
    explains why differing how we take folds based on survey design is useful.
