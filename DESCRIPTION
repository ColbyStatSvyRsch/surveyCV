Description: Functions to generate K-fold cross validation (CV) folds
    and CV test error estimates that take into account
    how a survey dataset's sampling design was constructed
    (SRS, clustering, stratification, and/or unequal sampling weights).
    You can input linear and logistic regression models, along with data and a 
    type of survey design in order to get an output that can help you determine
    which model best fits the data using K-fold cross validation.
    Our paper on "K-Fold Cross-Validation for Complex Sample Surveys"
    by Wieczorek, Guerin, and McMahon (2022)
    <doi:10.1002/sta4.454>
    explains why differing how we take folds based on survey design is useful.
