# TODO: Add code showing how we download and processed the NSFG dataset
# and how we saved it as a .Rda file to /data directory.

# TODO: Remove the .csv file from the /data-raw directory
# and only keep code here.

# TODO: Figure out how to get .Rbuildignore to ignore /data-raw
# so that R CMD CHECK doesn't complain about it.
