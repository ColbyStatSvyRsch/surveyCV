# Our `NSFG_data` dataset is a pre-processed version of the
# 2015-2017 National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG), specifically the
# Female Respondent Data File (2015_2017_FemRespData.dat) and
# Female Pregnancy Data File (2015_2017_FemPregData.dat).
# Both original datasets are available here:
# https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nsfg/nsfg_2015_2017_puf.htm

# We pre-processed the data following Hunter Ratliff's code on RPubs here:
# https://rpubs.com/HunterRatliff1/NSFG_Wrangle
# up through the creation and editing of the `data0` dataset.



# TODO: Add explicit code for how we downloaded and processed the NSFG dataset

# TODO: Add code for how we saved it as a .Rda file to the ~/data directory

# TODO: Remove the .csv file from the ~/data-raw directory
# and only keep the code here
