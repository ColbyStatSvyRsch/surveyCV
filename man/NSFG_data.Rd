\title{Subset of the 2015-2017 National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG): one birth per respondent.}
\format{
A data frame with 2801 rows and 17 variables:
\describe{
  \item{CASEID}{Respondent ID number (per respondent, not per pregnancy)}
  \item{LBW}{(originally LBW1) Low birthweight (TRUE/FALSE) for the 1st baby from this pregnancy}
  \item{PreMe}{(recode of WKSGEST) Whether gestational age was premature (below 37 weeks) or full term}
  \item{gotPNcare}{(recode of BGNPRENA) Whether or not respondent got prenatal care in first trimester (before 13 weeks)}
  \item{KnowPreg}{(recode of KNEWPREG) Whether or not respondent learned she was pregnant by 6 weeks}
  \item{age}{(originally AGECON) Age at time of conception}
  \item{income}{(originally POVERTY) Income as percent of poverty level, so that 100 = income is at the poverty line; topcoded at 500}
  \item{YrEdu}{(originally EDUCAT) Education (number of years of schooling)}
  \item{race}{(originally HISPRACE) Race & Hispanic origin of respondent}
  \item{BMI}{Body Mass Index}
  \item{PregNum}{(originally PREGNUM) Respondent's total number of pregnancies}
  \item{eduCat}{(originally HIEDUC) Highest completed year of school or highest degree received}
  \item{GA}{(originally WKSGEST) Gestational length of completed pregnancy (in weeks)}
  \item{Wanted}{(recode of NEWWANTR) Whether or not pregnancy came at right time according to respondent (rather than too soon, too late, or unwanted)}
  \item{wgt}{(originally WGT2015_2017) Final weight for the 2015-2017 NSFG (at the respondent level, not pregnancy level)}
  \item{SECU}{Randomized version of cluster ID, or "sampling error computational unit" -- these are nested within strata}
  \item{strata}{(originally SEST) Randomized version of stratum ID}

\description{
We downloaded this data from the NSFG website and cleaned it following
an approach posted to RPubs by Hunter Ratliff.
}
\details{
Note that these data were filtered down to include only:

- live births,
- with gestational ages below 45 weeks,
- born to mothers who were aged 20-40 years old at time of conception;

...then filtered further down to only the *first* such birth per respondent.

Also note that SECUs = Sampling Error Computation Units are effectively
pseudo-PSUs, nested within (pseudo-)strata. See page 35 of the NSFG
2011-2013 sample design documentation for details.
