}
\arguments{
\item{Data}{CSV of dataset to be tested}

\item{formulae}{Vector of formulas containing the variables to be compared in
cross validation}

\item{nfolds}{Number of folds to be used during cross validation, defaults to
5}

\item{strataID}{String of the variable used to Stratify during sampling, must
be the same as in the dataset used}

\item{clusterID}{String of the variable used to cluster during sampling, must
be the same as in the dataset used}

\item{nest}{Specify if nest = TRUE if clusters are nested within strata
 @examples
#MSEs generated for a stratified test of a first and second degree polynomial
# fit predicting mpg from horsepower in the Auto Dataset, Stratified on the
# "year" variable
data("Auto")
cv.gen.lm(Auto, c("mpg~poly(horsepower,1, raw = TRUE)", "mpg~poly(horsepower,2, raw = TRUE)"), nfolds = 10, strataID = "year", N = 400)}

\item{N}{Number equal to the total population size}

\item{method}{string, must be either linear or logistic, determines type of
model fit during cross validation, defaults to linear}

\item{weights}{Variable in data set that contains PPS weights}
}
\description{
this is a cross validation function designed for survey samples taken using a SRS,
stratified, Clustered, or Clustered and Stratified sampling design
